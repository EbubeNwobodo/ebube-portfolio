## The Physicist Who Architected the Cloud

I didn't start my journey in a server room; I started it in a physics lab. Graduating with a **B.Sc. in Physics**, I was trained to understand how complex systems behave, how energy flows, and how entropy (disorder) is inevitable.

Today, I apply those same principles to **Cloud Infrastructure**. 

As a **Senior Solutions Architect & DevOps Engineer**, I don't just write scripts; I design systems that are resilient to chaos. Whether it's orchestrating Kubernetes clusters or automating security pipelines, my goal is to reduce "operational entropy" eliminating manual toil and downtime through rigorous automation.

### My Philosophy: "Shift Left"
I believe reliability isn't an afterthought; it's an architectural decision.
* **Automation First:** If I have to do it twice, I automate it using **Terraform** or **Ansible**.
* **Security by Design:** I integrate security tools like **Trivy** early in the pipeline, rather than patching leaks in production.
* **Data-Driven:** You can't improve what you can't measure. I rely heavily on **Dynatrace** and **ELK Stack** to make informed infrastructure decisions.

### Professional Journey
Currently, I serve as a **Senior Solutions Architect** at **Latrims Solution**, where I focus on optimizing serverless architectures and AWS Lambda performance. 

Previously, I worked with **Snapnet Solutions** and **Tek Experts** , where I led large-scale migrations to Azure and reduced deployment times by up to 70%. My work often involves bridging the gap between development, security, and operations teams to ensure seamless delivery.

### Certifications & Tech Stack
I am a lifelong learner committed to staying agile in the tech landscape.

**Certifications:**
* Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT)
* Azure Solutions Architect Expert
* Azure DevOps Engineer Expert
* Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104)
